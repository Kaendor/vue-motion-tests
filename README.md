# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Motion-vue

This uses the
[Motion-vue](https://motion.unovue.com/getting-started/introduction) library for
animations and [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) for utilities.
Components are based on [ArkUI](https://ark-ui.com/vue/docs/components/)

This is a little repo to play with animations and micro-interactions.
